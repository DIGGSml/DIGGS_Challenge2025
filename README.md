# DIGGS Code Jam 2025

Welcome to the **DIGGS Code Jam 2025**, hosted by the ASCE Geo-Institute! This event is all about **collaboration, innovation, and creativity**. Together, we aim to explore the possibilities of geotechnical data exchange using DIGGS (Data Interchange for Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists). There are **no winners or losers**—just a community of problem-solvers working toward a shared goal.

At the conclusion of this event, we’ll showcase the tools and solutions created during the Code Jam at **Geo-Congress/Geo-Frontiers 2025**. Let’s build the future of geotechnical data sharing, together!

## What is the DIGGS Code Jam?

Think of the DIGGS Code Jam as a **geotechnical game jam**—a fun, collaborative environment where participants can:

- Experiment with DIGGS files
- Create innovative tools and solutions
- Share knowledge and ideas with the community
- Contribute to advancing DIGGS as an industry standard

This event is not a competition but an opportunity to learn, build, and grow as a community. By the end, your work will contribute to shaping the future of geotechnical data exchange!
